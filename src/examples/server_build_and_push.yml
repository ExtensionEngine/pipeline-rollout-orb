  The "build_and_push_server_to_aws_ecr" job builds a Docker image, authenticates the job
  with AWS using OIDC identity tokens, and pushes the image to ECR.
  By default, the SHA1 hash of the commit and the "latest" string are used as a tag for
  the image, while the AWS account, role, and region are sourced from the environment.

  The "build_and_push_server_to_aws_ecr" job builds a Docker image, authenticates the job
  with AWS using OIDC identity tokens, and pushes the image to ECR. As a part of this process,
  various out-of-the-box security controls are executed against code, dependencies and image.
  In the end, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated.
  By default, the SHA1 hash of the latest commit and the "latest" string are used as a tag for
  the image, while the AWS account, role, and region are sourced from the environment.
